# Meta Front-End Developer Capstone Project

This repository contains the final capstone project for the **Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate**. The goal of this project was to showcase the skills and knowledge gained throughout the course, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design principles.

## Project Overview

The project is a **single-page web application** designed to provide users with an interactive and engaging experience. It integrates various web development concepts such as dynamic content rendering, API integration, responsive design, and modern JavaScript practices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Modern Web Development Techniques**: Uses modern front-end development best practices, including modular CSS with Flexbox and Grid, and efficient JavaScript code for asynchronous data handling.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of the application.
- `style.css` – Contains the styling for the web page, including layout and responsiveness.
- `app.js` – The JavaScript file responsible for dynamic content rendering, API interaction, and user interactions.
- `assets/` – Folder containing any images or assets used in the project.

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactivity, such as user authentication or real-time data updates.
- Improve accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).
- Enhance mobile performance and optimize for lower-end devices.
